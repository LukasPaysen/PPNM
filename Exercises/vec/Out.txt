Task 1: 

vector u = (3, 3, 3)
vector v = (2, 2, 2)

Task 2:
testing /: dividing u by 3: u/3 = (1, 1, 1)
testing +: u + v = (5, 5, 5)
testing -: u - v = (1, 1, 1)

Task 3:
u.dot(v) = 18
vec.dot(u,v) = 18
Are u and v equal according to our approx method? u.approx(v) = False
What if u = (2,2,2)? u.approx(v) = True

Task 4: 
Testing our overwritten ToString() method: u.ToString() = 2 2 2
