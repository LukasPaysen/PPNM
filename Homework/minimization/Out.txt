Task A:
Finding a minimum of Himmelblau's and Rosensbrock's valley function whilst also recording the number of steps it takes our algorithm to reach the minimum

Rosenbrock start:
x0 = (-1.2, 2)
f(x0) = 36.2
Rosenbrock result:
x = (0.999991, 0.999982)
f(x) = 8.07508E-11
iterations = 25

Himmelblau start:
x0 = (0, 0)
f(x0) = 170
Himmelblau result:
x = (3, 2)
f(x) = 2.63099E-14
iterations = 7


Task B: 
Creating a plot of the data points along with the fit by the Breit-Wigner function.
Best fit: m=125.972186710209, Î“=2.08633072455643, A=9.876215183306, iterations=14
See the plot in the file higgs.png


Task C:
Comparing central and forward finite difference approximation. 
We do the exactly the same example as in task A and see if there is difference in the number of iterations.

Rosenbrock start:
x0 = (-1.2, 2)
f(x0) = 36.2

Rosenbrock result central differences:
x = (1, 1)
f(x) = 3.28448E-23
Rosenbrock: forward iters=25, central iters=23
So central differences got a slightly more precise result using two fewer iterations.

Himmelblau start:
x0 = (0, 0)
f(x0) = 170

Himmelblau result central differences:
x = (3, 2)
f(x) = 6.25631E-19
Rosenbrock: forward iters=7, central iters=7
So central differences got a slightly more precise result but with the same amount of iterations for Himmelblau.
